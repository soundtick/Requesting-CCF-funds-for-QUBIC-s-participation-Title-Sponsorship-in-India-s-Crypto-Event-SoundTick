## 🎥 About the Team and SoundTick

Please watch the video here → [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/r781XfvacdU)

Without any CCF funds, we (SoundTick and a 4-member team) have already conducted activities independently at **Metamorphosis Delhi**, held on *27–28 September 2025* at **Le Meridien, Gurgaon, India.**

We are **not part of any official QUBIC roles** such as Ambassador or Community Lead. We simply trust the project, **CFB**, and are passionate about expanding its visibility in India.

I have been following the project since **December 2023** and started tweeting about it in **February 2024:**
