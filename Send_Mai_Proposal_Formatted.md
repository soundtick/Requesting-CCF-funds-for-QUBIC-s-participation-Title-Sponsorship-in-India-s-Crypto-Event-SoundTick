## About the Team and SoundTick

Please watch the video here → YouTube https://youtu.be/r781XfvacdU This video illustrates our workflow.

**Without any CCF funds,** we (SoundTick and a 4-member team) have already conducted activities independently at **Metamorphosis Delhi**, held on *27–28 September 2025* at **Le Meridien, Gurgaon, India.**

This time, the same team SoundTick, expanded to 15 members, is going to participate in the upcoming India Blockchain Tour 2025 (IBT 2025) - also known as India’s Premier Web3 x AI Gala (Metamorphosis) - scheduled to take place in Chennai on 29 November 2025.

We are **not part of any official QUBIC roles** such as Ambassador or Community Lead. We simply trust the project, **CFB**, and are passionate about expanding its visibility in India.

I have been following the project since **December 2023** and started tweeting about it in **February 2024:**  
 Tweet Reference https://x.com/SoundTick/status/1762812817231729037

It’s been almost **two years of journey** with the QUBIC project, and now I am taking the initiative to expand its presence across India.
